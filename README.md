#### Title

Prediction of unplanned readmission cases using Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning Architectures

#### Abstract

> Unplanned hospital readmission is one of the main concerns for health care institutions, since it represents a patient's exposure to risk and a preventable waste of medical resources. Automatically identifying patients with a higher risk of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) readmission would help to efficiently reallocate the medical resources that would be unnecessary used during a readmission. 
> 
> The analysis and prediction of unplanned ICU readmission will be studied by means of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Including state-of-the-art approaches like transfer learning with pre-trained models. In particular, caregivers' text notes about patients discharge at the ICU will be analysed. For that purpose, de-identified database MIMIC-III (‘Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care’), of limited access provided by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, will be used. This large, single-center data-set includes high-resolution information associated to 61532 patients admitted to critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.

> Based on this data analysis, a performance comparison of the different DL-based strategies will be presented. Results show that simpler statistical models yield the best performance in comparison to DL-based models.
